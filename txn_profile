Name : Transaction profile Generalized
Grid name : txn_profile

Description: this grid is designed for the purpose
of supplying some major details of the process to
evaluate its potential for improvement.

re-cycle database to reset accumulative counters

refresh 90 â€“ scale down based on performance 
create from command line:

load  1 user-users connected
load  2 transactions-transaction load (1)
load  3 transactions-transaction load (2)
load  4 loading wait(s)-user wait description
load  5 undo-generating undo
load  6 temp-session temp usage
load  7 cursors-user current open cursors
load  8 locking-row lock waits
load  9 locking-blocking sessions
load 10 memory-user block io
load 11 user-user pga usage
load 12 session-top sessions by cpu
load 13 performance-system load

save grid txn_profile

to load this grid next time: load grid txn_profile

Interpetation

working left to right cell by cell row,cell:

1,1 : sid and username to match to remaining cells
1,2 : use sid to match to serial# and program name
1,3 : would provide details on undo segment usage
1,4 : will show waits and amont of time waited, this can provide
      an area for improvement
2,1 : this metric will reveal undo generated, and a possible 
      area of immprovement
2,2 : this metric shows temp storge being used for sorting showing
      that the operation could not sort in memory and an index may
      be needed
2,3 : this will show cursors, which could be  aproblem if cursors 
      are being recursively created
2,4 : row lock waits show waiting is occurring when a lock is 
    : requested, possibly showing a need for bulk updates to reduce 
      the locks/waits
3,1 : this metric will show process blocking a running process,
      if it is discovered it is a background process the some system 
      tuning may be needed
3,2 : this metric will show memory blocks read/written which may 
      be coupled with another indicator such as buffer waits
3,3 : this metric will indicate if the amount of memory
      dedicated to the program global area is sufficient
3,4 : this metric will indicate cpu by session, checking server
      metric could show if there is a cpu constraint
4,1 : this metric is the current system load on the server where
      the database server is hosted
